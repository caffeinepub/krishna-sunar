  "summary": "The diff adds a new PortfolioVideoGallery component and integrates it into AboutContactPage as a new Videos section below MediaPortraits. Most core requirements appear implemented (static HTML5 videos, responsive grid, no autoplay, aspect-ratio reserved). One acceptance criterion around a poster-missing fallback placeholder is not clearly satisfied based on the current overlay behavior.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "If a poster image is specified for a video entry, it is applied to the <video> element; otherwise a styled fallback placeholder is shown.",
      "reason": "The component passes `poster={video.poster}`, but all listed video items omit `poster`, and the only 'fallback placeholder overlay' is always present and is set to `opacity-0` (only becomes visible on hover). There is no conditional UI that clearly shows a placeholder when `poster` is not provided / before the video loads.",
